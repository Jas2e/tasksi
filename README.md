# 📝 Tasksi (JavaScript)

A simple and functional **To-Do List** application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Remove completed tasks
- Save and persist tasks using **Local Storage**

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Add Task**: Enter your task and add it to the list
- ☑️ **Check / Uncheck Task**: Mark tasks as done or undone
- ❌ **Delete Task**: Remove a task after completion
- 💾 **Local Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so your data stays even after refreshing the page

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter a task in the input field
2. Click **Add** to insert it into your list
3. Use the **checkbox** to mark it completed or not
4. Click the **delete button** to remove the task
